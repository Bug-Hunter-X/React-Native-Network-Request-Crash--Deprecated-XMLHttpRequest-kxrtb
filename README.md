# React Native Network Request Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: using a deprecated method for network requests (`XMLHttpRequest`) without proper error handling. This leads to crashes when network requests fail.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using the `fetch` API with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code utilizes `XMLHttpRequest`, which is less efficient and less supported than modern alternatives.  It also lacks proper error handling, causing application crashes when network errors occur. 

## Solution

The solution leverages the modern `fetch` API. It also includes comprehensive error handling using `.then()` and `.catch()` to gracefully manage errors, preventing application crashes and providing helpful feedback to the user.
